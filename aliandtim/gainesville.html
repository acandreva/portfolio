<p>Her story:</p>
<p>I was looking for "forever" - I was always looking for "forever" - and when I met Tim, I found it.</p>
<p>On Aug. 31, 2009, I was matched with him and about 10 other men on eHarmony. After briefly looking through profiles, I deleted all but Tim's, and figured "If he contacts me, then we'll see where it goes."</p> 
<p>I got a message the next day.</p>
<p>Those first couple of weeks, we messaged each other on eHarmony, and then ... I gave him my phone number. When he called I felt like I was 15 again - "Don't giggle too much, Ali," "Did you really just say that, Ali?" "Don't forget to breathe."</p>
<p> And then we decided to meet.</p>
<p>Now, I know that life is not a movie. There is no background music, and I wasn't expecting Tim to arrive on a white horse or anything. But when I saw him for the first time, I swear it happened in slow motion. The world stopped for those few seconds, and I really did fall in love.</p>
