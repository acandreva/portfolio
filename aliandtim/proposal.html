<p>There are only so many hours in a day, so for me, every second counts.</p> 
<p>No, I’m not talking “living life to the fullest,” I’m talking “sweep the floors before work because I had a few extra minutes.”</p>
<p>That’s usually how my mornings go. I run around putting things away, just to tidy a bit now, so I can relax later.</p>
<p>Well on this particular morning, May 24 to be exact, I came upon a plastic bag from Michaels with some blue yarn in it. I know I didn’t buy any yarn, so I called Tim …</p>
<p>“Dear … did you buy some yarn?”</p>
<p>“Uh … yea. When I was at PetSmart buying dog food, I went over to Michaels to get something, and it was on sale. I thought you might like it … it’s blue.”</p>
<p>“… All right, honey.”</p>
<p>I really thought nothing of it. At most I thought I ruined part of my birthday present, it being three days away.</p>
<h2>Later that night:</h2>
<p>Six o’clock rolls around, and as I’m leaving work, I get a text from Tim saying he’s leaving work as well.</p>
<p>I get home and start walking to the apartment when I notice an envelope on the door. At first I’m annoyed because I think the apartment complex has put something on our door, but as I get close I can see it says: “Open Me &hearts;.” </p>
<p>The note is from Tim (of course), and it says he lied about the yarn. I read quickly through the rest and slowly open the door.</p>
<p>I had pictured the way Tim would propose a hundred times in my head, but what I saw embodied the man I was about to say yes to.</p>
<p>In front of me were pieces of paper hanging from strings of blue yarn. Each one part of a timeline of our relationship: from the day we were matched to our first date; the day we said “I love you” and the day we got Daisy. All leading through the apartment, up the stairs and down the hall to our bedroom ... where Tim was waiting dressed in a suit ... with a ring.</p>
