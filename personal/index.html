<p>Welcome to my Web site. My name is Allison Candreva, and I am a student at the <a href="http://www.ufl.edu" target="_blank">University of Florida</a>. I am originally from Long Island, N.Y., and moved to Wellington, Fla., when I was 11 years old. Even though I have lived in Florida for so many years, I still consider myself a Newyorker at heart. The majority of my extended family is in New York, and every year my family and I go up to visit them at least two or three times.</p>
<p>I have an older brother named Josh and an older sister named Sarah who just got married this pasted March to a man named Nick. Growing up, I always had pets. Whether it was a fish, a hamster or a bird, I <img src="images/coco.jpg" alt="Coco" width="175" height="116" class="left" />always had something. One thing that we, as a family, always had was a dog.</p> 
<p>Currently, we have three. Since I am away at college, I only get to see them when I go home to visit my family. I think that is the hardest thing about not living with my parents. I can talk to my family on the phone, but I can't talk to my dogs. Although everytime I go home, it's nice to have them be so excited to see me.</p>
<p>After I graduated high school, I spent my freshman year at a culinary school in Miami but decided to change my major after an internship wasn't going so well (along with many other things). Since the culinary school didn't offer any other majors that I wanted, I moved back to Wellington. <img src="images/dixie.jpg" alt="Dixie" width="175" height="116" class="right" />I went to a couple of colleges, including <a href="http://www.pbcc.cc.fl.us/" target="_blank">Palm Beach Community College</a> and <a href="http://www.santafe.cc.fl.us/" target="_blank">Santa Fe College</a>, before ending up at UF. Even though it was a tough decision, I have to say that leaving culinary school was one of the best choices that I have made.</p>
<p>I am currently a journalism major, and the <a href="http://www.jou.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">College of Journalism and Communications</a> has given me all of the opportunities that I've hoped for. I've been able to pursue my love of photography, design and editing. And all in one place!</p>
<p>This is a site dedicated to things about me. What I like to do, where I like to go and things of that sort. I hope you enjoy my site and that you gain some knowledge about me and possibly some tips for travel.</p>
