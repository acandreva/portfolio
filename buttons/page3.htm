<h1>Three</h1>
<p>This exercise is about both link styles and color. The primary lesson is about
  styling navigation lists, as described by Molly 
  Holzschlag in Chapter 10 of her book <i>Spring into HTML and CSS</i>. It is
  necessary to understand how to use color well if you are designing Web pages.
  The choices of color for links and link effects should be made along with the
  decisions about color for the entire page (or the entire Web site).</p>

  and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and

  their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for
  their Services a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance
  in Office.</p>
