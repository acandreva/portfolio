<p>This exercise is about both link styles and color. The primary lesson is about
  styling navigation lists, as described by Molly 
  Holzschlag in Chapter 10 of her book <i>Spring into HTML and CSS</i>. It is
  necessary to understand how to use color well if you are designing Web pages.
  The choices of color for links and link effects should be made along with the
  decisions about color for the entire page (or the entire Web site).</p>
<p>We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union,
  establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense,
  promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves
  and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United
  States of America. </p>
