<h1>Two</h1>
<p>This exercise is about both link styles and color. The primary lesson is about
  styling navigation lists, as described by Molly 
  Holzschlag in Chapter 10 of her book <i>Spring into HTML and CSS</i>. It is
  necessary to understand how to use color well if you are designing Web pages.
  The choices of color for links and link effects should be made along with the
  decisions about color for the entire page (or the entire Web site).</p>
<h2>Article II</h2>
<h3>Section 1</h3>
<p>The executive Power shall be vested in a President of
  the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four
  Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be
  elected, as follows: </p>
<p>Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature
  thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators
  and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but
  no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit
  under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector. </p>
