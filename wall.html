<h3>Wall Project Tumbles Down</h3>
<h4>By Allison Candreva</h4>
<h4>February 4, 2008</h4>
<h4><i>Alligator Contributing Writer</i></h4>
<p>As the crowd counted down from 10, the Writing on the Wall staff members checked their safety goggles and gripped their ropes tightly.</p>
<p>Cameras went off as the 40-foot by 7-foot wall pounded the ground and broke into pieces. The dust settled and students from the crowd jumped into the rubble to shatter unbroken pieces.</p>
<p>The closing ceremony of the sixth annual Writing on the Wall Project was held Friday afternoon. A crowd of about 50 people gathered on the Plaza of the Americas to watch the wall fall to the ground.</p>
<p>Allan Spear Construction assembled the wall Jan. 28 from blocks painted with stereotypical phrases and words of discrimination. The project was intended <q>to literally and metaphorically break down a wall of hatred and oppression,</q> according to a fact sheet.</p>
<p>University of Florida student Victoria Ajayi won an essay contest and read her essay at the ceremony.</p>
<p><q>A hateful word is nothing, absolutely nothing, without people,</q> Ajayi said.</p>
<p>Even though she did not paint her own block, there were definitely ones she could identify with.</p>
<p><q>We, as human beings, have an enormous responsibility to one another,</q> she said. <q>We must eradicate these words.</q></p>
<p>Lesa Boykin, a residence director for Maguire Village and University Village South at UF, gave a presentation and read a spoken-word poem called <q>Lets Be Careful.</q></p>
<p>Boykin said the project gets people thinking.</p>
<p><q>We have got to go out of our own comfort zones and build relationships,</q> she said.</p>
<p>Lucinda Poudrier-Aaronson, the faculty adviser for the project, said about 380 blocks were painted.</p>
<p>Aaronson said, who has been the adviser for the past two years, said she likes the project because it generates discussion.</p>
<p><q>Dialogue is important,</q> Aaronson said, <q>It will move people to action. It will bring the community together.</q></p>
